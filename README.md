# Design Patterns in C#
## Overview
This repository offers an in-depth exploration of Design Patterns in C# and .NET. It includes:

- Utilization of the latest C# and .NET framework versions
- Adoption of contemporary programming methodologies such as dependency injection and reactive programming
- Use of modern development tools like ReSharper
- Examination of pattern variations and alternative methods
- It thoroughly covers all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as detailed in their influential book, alongside modern adaptations, refinements, and intrinsic usage within the language.

## Prerequisites
- Strong proficiency in C#
- Familiarity with the latest C# features
- In-depth understanding of object-oriented design principles

## Patterns Covered
This repository includes comprehensive coverage of all Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, encompassing creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Additionally, it delves into SOLID design principles, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of both fundamental and advanced design concepts in C#. Each pattern is explored with practical examples and modern variations. The full list includes:

- SOLID Design Principles
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Open-Closed Principle
  - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
- Creational Design Patterns
  - Builder
  - Factories (Factory Method and Abstract Factory)
  - Prototype
  - Singleton
- Structural Design Patterns
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Fa√ßade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
- Behavioral Design Patterns
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Null Object
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor

## Target Audience
This repository is tailored for .NET/C# developers aiming to go beyond basic examples and understand the various adaptations and techniques for implementing design patterns in modern development.

## File Format and Usage
Since all examples are consolidated in this repository and the files are in .txt format, you can easily convert them back to the original .cs files by simply removing the .txt extension. This allows you to run and modify the code directly in your preferred C# development environment. The repository emphasizes code over UML class diagrams, utilizing tools such as Visual Studio, various NuGet packages, the ReSharper unit test runner, and dotMemoryUnit.
